        <h5>Check How Current Media Views Topics</h5>
        <p> BiasFinder is a website that aims to help people identify bias in the news. In today's world, the media has
            a significant impact on our lives, from influencing our political views to shaping our opinions on business
            and social issues. It is essential to be aware of the biases present in the news we consume to make informed
            decisions.
        </p>

            BiasFinder pulls news articles from NewsAPI based on the topic chosen by the user. The website then conducts
            a sentiment analysis on the articles to determine the overall tone of the news. The sentiment analysis helps
            to identify any biases present in the news articles. The website also provides a breakdown of the sentiment
            analysis, showing the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral articles on the topic.
            The sentiment analysis is conducted using natural language processing techniques, which analyze the text of
            the news articles to determine the sentiment. The polarity of the text measures the positivity of the topic,
            while the subjectivity
            explains how factual the text is. The sentiment analysis is conducted using the TextBlob library in Python.
            Extracting the information itself comes from getting the data from NewsAPI, which is a news aggregator that
            provides a large collection of news articles from various sources. The website is built using Django, a
            Python web framework.
